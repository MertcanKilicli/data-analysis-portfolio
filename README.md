# Mertcan Kılıçlı-Data Analysis Portfolio

Hi, I'm Mertcan! I am a 4th year student in the statistics department. I am actively working on improving my python skills. I do projects on Data analysis and shape my knowledge with the theoretical knowledge that my department gives me. After trying to improve myself in the field of front-end development for 2 years, I saw that I was more inclined to the fields of Data Science and Data Analysis, so I focused on this field. Advance in the field of data analysis and. I want to improve myself.I am a 4th year student in the statistics department. I am actively working on improving my python skills.

My CV

This repository serves as a showcase of my skills, a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science-related topics. 

# Study projects
